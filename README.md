# OODJ ASSIGNMENT

Hi everyone! This is the place for us to code our Java assignment.
Be responsible and complete your tasks on time. 👍🏻

---------------------------------------------------------------------
THINGS TO TAKE NOTE: RUNNING PROJECT ON NETBEANS
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
   
2. **FOR NETBEANS USER**\
   Go to NetBeans -> Open Project -> Select this project

3. **FOR INTELLIJ IDEA USERS**\
   Go to IntelliJ IDEA -> Open -> Select this project
   
4. The `Main` class is located under `\src\main\java\main\Main.java`.\
   Navigate to the `Main.java` file and run it (or click on Run Project for Netbeans).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
THINGS TO TAKE NOTE: STORING FILES
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. All codes are stored under `/src/main/java`:\
   a. Codes for GUI are stored in `/Frontend`\
   b. Codes for others (ex: users) are stored in `/Backend`\
   c. The Main class is stored under `/Main`
   
3. All pictures are stored under `/src/main/resources/asset`
   
4. All text files are stored in `/src/main/resources/text_file`

**IMPORTANT**:
Please follow the conventionals when naming your classes, methods and variables:
- Classes: Use PascalCase (eg: `myNewClass`)
- Methods and variables: Use camelCase (eg: `myNewMethod`)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
THINGS TO TAKE NOTE: CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROJECT
---------------------------------------------------------------------
To update your changes, follow the steps here:

1. Create a branch based on `Development` and update your commits under the branch
   (Do come out with a good name that clearly depicts what you have done)
   
2. Go to GitHub website and create a pull request
   
3. Add `BengRhui` or `cmchan04` as a reviewer
   
4. And you're done! We'll update you if there's anything to change.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
THINGS TO TAKE NOTE: RUNNING TEST CASES
---------------------------------------------------------------------
To run individual test cases,

1. Navigate to the corresponding classes (under `/test/java`)
   
2. Run the class (For Netbeans, right click and select "Test File")

To run all test cases at one shot,

- For Netbeans, right click the project and select "Test"
- For IntelliJ IDEA, show Maven tool window (at the right hand side)
  and double click on "Test" under `Lifecycle`.

Adjustments **MUST** be made shall there be any failures.
